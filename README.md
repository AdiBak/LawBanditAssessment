## Project Overview

This application serves as a demonstration of advanced PDF processing capabilities combined with intelligent chat functionality. The primary goal was to create a system that can handle dense legal documents, long syllabi, and multiple PDFs simultaneously while providing accurate, context-aware responses.

### Core Objectives

1. **Enhanced RAG System**: Implement a retrieval-augmented generation system that can accurately process and respond to queries across multiple PDF documents
2. **Advanced PDF Reader**: Create a robust PDF viewer with sophisticated highlighting, annotation, and markup capabilities
3. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure the system can handle large documents and multiple PDFs without performance degradation
4. **User Experience**: Design an intuitive interface that matches LawBandit's aesthetic while providing powerful functionality

## Technical Approach

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Implementation

The RAG system was designed with a focus on accuracy and performance when handling multiple legal documents:

**Text Processing Pipeline:**
- PDF text extraction using `pdfjs-dist` for reliable content parsing
- Intelligent text chunking that preserves semantic meaning across sentences and paragraphs
- Context-aware chunking that maintains legal document structure and references

**Embedding Strategy:**
- OpenAI embeddings for high-quality vector representations
- Batch processing to handle multiple PDFs efficiently
- Smart caching to avoid reprocessing already analyzed documents

**Query Processing:**
- Multi-PDF context aggregation for comprehensive responses
- Source attribution with page references for transparency
- Fallback mechanisms for handling edge cases and errors

### PDF Reader Architecture

The PDF reader was built using `react-pdf-viewer` for its robust rendering capabilities:

**Highlighting System:**
- Integration with the official highlight plugin for reliable text selection
- Custom color palette with persistent storage
- Comment system linked to highlights for detailed annotations
- Historical highlights management with navigation capabilities

**User Interface:**
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Dark/light mode support for user preference
- Draggable resizing for optimal workspace utilization
- Intuitive toolbar with context-sensitive controls
